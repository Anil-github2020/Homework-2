# Homework-2

This repository is created to submit Homework 2 by uploading the Java code along with the results output, and readme file. The agenda of Homework 2 is to build a Java code with 5-grade variables and find the average of the grade of a student. In this java code first I've created 5 variables and assigned the grades. Next, calculate the average of those 5 variables. By using "if" and "else" condition, I've compared the average with the grade. The matching condition will print the given statement.Â
